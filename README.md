# terraform-aws-cloudtrail-s3-bucket [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudtrail-s3-bucket.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudtrail-s3-bucket) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudtrail-s3-bucket.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudtrail-s3-bucket/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module to provision an S3 bucket with built in policy to allow [CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/) [logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-and-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html).

In addtion to the main S3 bucket the module creates S3 Bucket for access logs for the first one.

This is useful if an organization uses a number of separate AWS accounts to isolate the Audit environment from other environments (production, staging, development).

In this case, you create CloudTrail in the production environment (Production AWS account),
while the S3 bucket to store the CloudTrail logs is created in the Audit AWS account, restricting access to the logs only to the users/groups from the Audit account.


The module supports the following:

1. Forced [server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html) at rest for the S3 bucket
2. S3 bucket [versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html) to easily recover from both unintended user actions and application failures
3. S3 bucket is protected from deletion if it's not empty ([force_destroy](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/s3_bucket.html#force_destroy) set to `false`)

[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudtrail-s3-bucket/releases).


```hcl
module "s3_bucket" {
  source    = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudtrail-s3-bucket.git?ref=master"
  namespace = "cp"
  stage     = "prod"
  name      = "cluster"
  region    = "us-east-1"
}
```






## Makefile Targets
```
Available targets:

  help                                Help screen
  help/all                            Display help for all targets
  help/short                          This help short screen
  lint                                Lint terraform code
