| access\_log\_bucket\_name | Name of the S3 bucket where s3 access log will be sent to | `string` | `""` | no |
| acl | The canned ACL to apply. We recommend log-delivery-write for compatibility with AWS services | `string` | `"log-delivery-write"` | no |
| arn\_format | ARN format to be used. May be changed to support deployment in GovCloud/China regions. | `string` | `"arn:aws"` | no |
| attributes | Additional attributes (e.g. `1`) | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| block\_public\_acls | Set to `false` to disable the blocking of new public access lists on the bucket | `bool` | `true` | no |
| block\_public\_policy | Set to `false` to disable the blocking of new public policies on the bucket | `bool` | `true` | no |
| delimiter | Delimiter to be used between `namespace`, `environment`, `stage`, `name` and `attributes` | `string` | `"-"` | no |
| enable\_glacier\_transition | Glacier transition might just increase your bill. Set to false to disable lifecycle transitions to AWS Glacier. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| enabled | Set to `false` to prevent the module from creating any resources | `bool` | `true` | no |
| environment | Environment, e.g. 'prod', 'staging', 'dev', 'pre-prod', 'UAT' | `string` | `""` | no |
| expiration\_days | Number of days after which to expunge the objects | `number` | `90` | no |
| force\_destroy | (Optional, Default:false ) A boolean that indicates all objects should be deleted from the bucket so that the bucket can be destroyed without error. These objects are not recoverable | `bool` | `false` | no |
| glacier\_transition\_days | Number of days after which to move the data to the glacier storage tier | `number` | `60` | no |
| ignore\_public\_acls | Set to `false` to disable the ignoring of public access lists on the bucket | `bool` | `true` | no |
| kms\_master\_key\_arn | The AWS KMS master key ARN used for the SSE-KMS encryption. This can only be used when you set the value of sse\_algorithm as aws:kms. The default aws/s3 AWS KMS master key is used if this element is absent while the sse\_algorithm is aws:kms | `string` | `""` | no |
| lifecycle\_prefix | Prefix filter. Used to manage object lifecycle events | `string` | `""` | no |

| namespace | Namespace, which could be your organization name or abbreviation, e.g. 'eg' or 'cp' | `string` | `""` | no |
| noncurrent\_version\_expiration\_days | Specifies when noncurrent object versions expire | `number` | `90` | no |
| noncurrent\_version\_transition\_days | Specifies when noncurrent object versions transitions | `number` | `30` | no |
| policy | A valid bucket policy JSON document. Note that if the policy document is not specific enough (but still valid), Terraform may view the policy as constantly changing in a terraform plan. In this case, please make sure you use the verbose/specific version of the policy | `string` | `""` | no |
| region | If specified, the AWS region this bucket should reside in. Otherwise, the region used by the callee | `string` | `""` | no |
| restrict\_public\_buckets | Set to `false` to disable the restricting of making the bucket public | `bool` | `true` | no |
| sse\_algorithm | The server-side encryption algorithm to use. Valid values are AES256 and aws:kms | `string` | `"AES256"` | no |
| stage | Stage, e.g. 'prod', 'staging', 'dev', OR 'source', 'build', 'test', 'deploy', 'release' | `string` | `""` | no |
| standard\_transition\_days | Number of days to persist in the standard storage tier before moving to the infrequent access tier | `number` | `30` | no |
| tags | Additional tags (e.g. `map('BusinessUnit','XYZ')` | `map(string)` | `{}` | no |
| versioning\_enabled | A state of versioning. Versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket | `bool` | `false` | no |
